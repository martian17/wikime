Attack tips
[pic 11:08]
Want some tips for perfect marauding?
Keep these steps in mind for a successful attack:
-Spy on your target to see the formation of the enemy
defenders.
-Counter the defense of enemy units. For example, the best
way to defeat melee defenders such as spearmen is with
ranged attackers. On the other hand, the best way to defeat
bowmen is with melee attackers.
-Don't forget to use tools. The defender's walls and tools give
them a strong combat bonus, but you can reduce it to 0% with
the right tools!
-Pick the parts of the wall with the weakest defense.
Attacking only the flanks can often give you a strategic
advantage.
-Remember the combat bonus in the courtyard! All the
soldiers you did not fight on the walls will be waiting for you
outside the Keep.
-If you only breach one section of the wall, you lose 30%
combat strength for the fight in the courtyard. If you breach
two sections of the wall, the fight is balanced. If you breach all
three parts of the wall, you will earn a 30% bonus for the fight!
